About SGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Stellar Game Engine (also "SGE" or simply "Stellar Engine") is an engine
for use with Stellar, in order to make its development easier and also
offer an option to those who want only a game engine without a graphical
interface.

SGE is supposed to be able to have differing "implementations"
available.  The first implementation developed has been one that uses
Pygame, but an implementation using Pyglet might be developed later, for
instance.  This allows increased flexibility in Stellar.


Developing an Implementation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To develop an implementation of SGE, copy sge-template and add in the
functionality.  In order to prevent confusion, do *not* use docstrings
on anything that is not included in the template, and do not modify the
docstrings except for adding in the name of the implementation and
implementation-specific information to the module docstring.  Use normal
comments to document custom functions specific to a given
implementation.

Note that, except where otherwise noted, all documented features are
required for an implementation to be considered complete.


Using SGE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Available implementations are in folders named as "sge-name", where
"name" is replaced with the name of the implementation.  To use SGE to
develop a game, copy the folder of the implementation you want to use to
the same directory as your main game script and rename it to "sge"
(note: all lowercase).  You can then import the module "sge".

Note that a given implemenation may have additional dependencies; see
the implementation's included DEPENDENCIES file to learn about them.
Also note that "sge-template" is not an implementation, but a template
for programming new implementations.

See the files contained in the "examples" directory for examples of
games written for SGE.  To run them, you must first add the folder of an
SGE implementation into the "examples" directory as described above.
See MANUAL for documentation of the SGE API.
