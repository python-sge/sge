INSTALLATION

First, install the dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or later <http://www.python.org>
- Pygame 1.9.1 or later <http://pygame.org>
- uniseg <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/uniseg>

Once you have all the dependencies, install the SGE with the included
setup.py script, e.g. with "python setup.py install".

Alternatively, you can just place the "sge" folder into the same
directory as the Python program that uses it. This can be a good idea
for the distribution of a game, since it reduces the number of
dependencies the user needs to install.


USAGE

See the "doc" folder for detailed documentation on how to use the SGE.
