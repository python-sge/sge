The SGE Game Engine ("SGE", pronounced like "Sage") is a general-purpose
2-D game engine.  It takes care of several details for you so you can
focus on the game itself.  This makes more rapid game development
possible, and it also makes the SGE easy to learn.

This implementation of the SGE uses Pygame as a backend.
